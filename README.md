The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01 - Fuel Efficiency EDA

In the `project_01/` folder you can find my submission for Data Visualization Mini Project 1 for CAP575. 

In the *report* folder, two .Rmd files are present.

- **report.Rmd**
- fuel_eda.Rmd

**report.Rmd** contains my write up along with all important visualizations. **fuel_eda.Rmd** is the *orginal* .Rmd where I did all of the code and design. 

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02 - Model Visualization, Interactive Plots, Spatial Maps

This project is an analysis of two Datasets in order to practice and demonstrate visualizing a model, interactive plots, and spatial maps.

**Sample data visualization:**
